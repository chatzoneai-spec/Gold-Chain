# GILT CHAIN: Go-To-Market Strategy

## CROSS-PROJECT AIRDROPS

Airdrop to holders of other projects to capture existing DeFi users and gold holders.

| Target Group | Why | How to Snapshot |
|--------------|-----|-----------------|
| **PAXG holders** | Direct target market - gold holders who want yield | Etherscan token holders list |
| **XAUT holders** | Same as above - Tether Gold users | Etherscan token holders list |
| **Lido stETH holders** | Already understand liquid staking, want diversification | Etherscan + Lido subgraph |
| **Aave/Compound users** | DeFi native, understand lending | Protocol subgraphs |
| **L1 token holders (ARB, OP)** | Active on-chain users, likely to bridge | Etherscan token holders |
| **Stablecoin whales** | Have capital, looking for yield | On-chain analysis |

**Precedent:** Optimism airdropped to users of competing protocols to capture liquidity.

## GTM OPTIONS

### Option 1: Testnet + Points → TGE (Berachain Style)

- Launch public testnet with points system
- Users interact with testnet, earn points
- Points convert to airdrop allocation at TGE
- Builds community and hype before mainnet

**Pros:** Strong community, battle-tested contracts, hype building
**Cons:** Longer timeline, sybil farming risk

### Option 2: Direct Mainnet Launch

- No public testnet phase
- Launch everything at once
- Airdrop to existing PAXG/XAUT/DeFi users based on historical snapshots
- Immediate bridging enabled

**Pros:** Faster to market, surprise factor
**Cons:** Less community building, higher risk

### Option 3: Hybrid (Recommended)

- Private testnet with select partners/VCs/auditors
- Announce airdrop eligibility criteria early (PAXG holders, DeFi users, etc.)
- Short public testnet (2-4 weeks) for final stress testing
- TGE with immediate bridging enabled

**Pros:** Best of both - community building + speed
**Cons:** Requires coordination

## PRE-LAUNCH MARKETING

### 1. VC/Fund Outreach

**Why early:**
- Initial liquidity (they bridge first, seed pools)
- Credibility signal (known names backing you)
- Distribution (they shill to their portfolio companies and followers)

**Target funds:**
- Crypto-native: Paradigm, a16z crypto, Polychain, Dragonfly
- DeFi-focused: Delphi Ventures, DeFiance Capital, Mechanism Capital
- Gold/macro: Grayscale, Galaxy Digital

**Pitch angle:** "First yield-bearing gold token - gold that pays 7-13% APY from real network activity"

### 2. Crypto Media

**Outlets:**
- Bankless (podcast + newsletter)
- The Block
- Decrypt
- CoinDesk
- Blockworks

**Story angles:**
- "First yield-bearing gold token"
- "Bringing the gold standard to DeFi"
- "Gold holders can finally earn yield without counterparty risk"

### 3. Crypto Twitter (CT)

**KOL categories to target:**
- Gold/macro accounts (Peter Schiff followers, gold bugs)
- DeFi yield hunters
- New L1 coverage accounts
- Trading/alpha accounts

**Content strategy:**
- Educational threads on gold + yield
- Comparison posts (PAXG 0% vs GOLD 7-13%)
- Behind-the-scenes development updates

### 4. Community Building

**Pre-launch:**
- Discord server with roles, channels, early access
- Telegram for announcements
- Ambassador program (reward active community members)

**Incentives:**
- Early Discord members get bonus airdrop allocation
- Testnet participation rewards
- Content creation bounties

## STAGGERED AIRDROP STRATEGY

Since you're launching 4 protocols, use staggered airdrops to create flywheel:

| Protocol | Airdrop To | Timing |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| **L1 (GILT)** | PAXG/XAUT holders, DeFi power users, early Discord | At TGE |
| **DEX token** | Early LPs, GILT stakers, bridge users | TGE + 2 weeks |
| **Liquid staking token** | stGOLD depositors, GILT stakers, DEX LPs | TGE + 4 weeks |
| **Lending token** | Suppliers/borrowers, stGOLD holders, GILT stakers | TGE + 6 weeks |

**Flywheel effect:**
1. Users bridge PAXG → get GOLD → stake for GILT airdrop
2. GILT stakers get DEX token airdrop → provide liquidity
3. LPs get liquid staking token airdrop → stake GOLD for stGOLD
4. stGOLD holders get lending token airdrop → supply to lending markets

Each airdrop rewards users of previous protocols, driving deeper engagement.

## TGE EVENT OPTIONS

### Option A: Big Bang Launch

Everything launches at once:
- L1 goes live
- Bridge opens
- DEX live with liquidity
- Liquid staking live
- Lending live
- All 4 tokens distributed

**Pros:** Maximum impact, complete ecosystem day 1
**Cons:** Complex coordination, higher risk

### Option B: Phased Launch

Staggered over 4-6 weeks:
- Week 1: L1 + Bridge + GILT token
- Week 2: DEX + DEX token
- Week 3: Liquid staking + token
- Week 4: Lending + token

**Pros:** Easier to manage, can fix issues between phases
**Cons:** Less hype, users wait for full ecosystem

### Option C: L1 First, DeFi After

- Launch L1 + Bridge first
- Let users bridge and use native staking
- Launch DeFi protocols (DEX, liquid staking, lending) 2-4 weeks later

**Pros:** Proves L1 stability before DeFi risk
**Cons:** Less compelling without full ecosystem
